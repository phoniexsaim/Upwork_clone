            <p className="font-[400] text-[20px] text-[#181818]">The world of work is not the same as it was just a few years ago and leaders are facing brand new challenges as a result. The old work  playbook is gone, and in its place, there are debates and decisions around workforce location, worker arrangements, and flexibility. However, leaders do not need to navigate this new world of work on their own.</p>
